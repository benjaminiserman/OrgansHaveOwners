# OrgansHaveOwners

this is a WIP mod for Rimworld that tracks the original source of organs and parts. this could be used to, for example, steal the arm of a pawn to use their biocoded weapons.

Currently I'm running into issues with how HediffComps don't seem to be saved by default, so progress on this mod is stalled until that's figured out.
